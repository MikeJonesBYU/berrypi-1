# Ansible

To start the server: `python3 server.py`

To start the client: `python3 client.py` or, if it's on a Pi, `./startclient`

## Setup

Usage for the `setupwidget.py` script:

`./setupwidget.py button`

Or just edit `widget.cfg` (first line is widget type, second line is sensor type, third line is widget number) and then run `./setupwidget.py` with no arguments.
